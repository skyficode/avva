This project is considered END-OF-LIFE.

To a degree is has been abandoned. v1.0.0 exists for Gilat and is release for Gilat RSA's with TinyMB products only. The various "advanced" commands are not supported in PSA or SNG builds. 

The "advanced" commands are not suitable for any other customer other than Gilat. The feature is potentially buggy and difficult to maintain/troubleshoot in firmware.

"Core" functions - such as:
 - AVCOM_SA_GetSpectrumData()
 - AVCOM_SA_LNBstruct()
 - AVCOM_SA_SetAllSettings()
may be used in all CSW Protocol products.
