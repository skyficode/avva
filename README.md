# avva
#### JavaScript library for communicating with AVCOM's Spectrum Analyzers

*Beware: this library was under-development and maybe incomplete or buggy! This code is shared "as-is" ‚Äì more example of the parsing `AVCOM CSW Protocol` then a ready-to-use package.*

The `avva` library communicates with an AVCOM SA using TCP and then can both send command and parse responses, including the spectrum data stream.  `avva` can be included in another project's `package.json`, same as any other node.js package, and used via the exported objects. 

 *However an AVCOM SA may only allow one TCP session so this approach has some limitations ‚Äì¬†specifically you may not be able to use the existing AVCOM tools at the same time as the `avva` library*

To provide support for multiple client users of the same spectrum analyser, the library could be extended to allow running as "deamon", and expose **POSSIBLE** **FUTURE** network APIs including:
  * Web server with basic HTML5 UI to emulate the existing SA clients
  * REST API for commands such as set FQ, etc.
  * WebSockets to stream spectrum data to most "modern things", like scientific notebooks including Wolfram, Observerable, or Julia+Pluto which offer rich graphing support.
  * Send a RTP **multicast** stream using "RTP events" containing the current spectrum data.  *Idea here be that the spectrum data could then be carried (e.g. `mux`) as part of a larger DVB GSE stream from a remote, for QA at a recieving earthstation hub.*

None of these are implemented today.
## Toolchain

#### `node` 

Any recent version should work.  This was developed using NodeJS v12 to v16 releases however.

#### `yarn`
This packages uses `yarn` for NodeJS packages.  Although, `npm` likely works.  

#### Environment Variables 
The dotenv package is used to load the needed AVCOM SA IP and port from environment variables or a `.env` file located in the root of the source code.  _The unit test need the .env set to `localhost` since the launch an poor-man's AVCOM simulator._

These environment variables are used:
```
AVCOM_IP=localhost
AVCOM_PORT=26482
```

## Specifications

The implementation is based on a PDF document provided by AVCOM that documents what they call `CSW Protocol`.  The protocol specs are included in `./etc` for reference here.  Their C/C++ example of CSW is also in the same directly.

## Using this source code

About the only thing you can do is run the unit test.  Even these were work in progress.  

Most of the source code in `./lib` should be "buggy but complete" - but without full unit test hard to know _how buggy_.  

To use the library in your own code, the unit test in `./test` should provide a good example of CSW usage.
